  No matter how smart we are, error are our contant comparents.With
  practic,we keep getting better at finding & correcting them




  // There are three types of error in java
  1] syntax error
  2] logical error
  3] runtime error

  syntax error:-
             when commpiler finds something wrong with our program
             it throws a syntax error

          
  logical error:-
             A logical error or a "bug" occures when a program
             compiles and runs ,but does the wrong thing
             
  runtime error:-
             Runtime errors occur when a program does not contain
             any syntax errors but asks the computer to do something
             that the computer is unable to reliably do. During
             compilation, the compiler has no technique to detect
             these kinds of errors. It is the JVM (Java Virtual
             Machine) which detects it while the program is running.
